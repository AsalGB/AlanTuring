            <h2>Early Life and Parents</h2>
            <p>Hailing from London, Cumberbatch was born with theater in his blood. His parents, Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, were well-known television actors when they had their son on July 19, 1976. <br>
               Despite their success, they tried to steer young Benedict away from the stage and sent him to Harrow public school, where he had been awarded an arts scholarship. <br>
               At Harrow, he displayed an interest in rugby and painting, but it was theater that captured his imagination. Under the mentorship of Martin Tyrrell, Cumberbatch's first role was as Titania, <br>
               Queen of the Faeries, in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream.
               Cumberbatch went on to teach English in Darjeeling, before returning to England to study drama at the University of <br>
               Manchester. After graduation, he spent a year at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.</p>

                    In 2015 the actor was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In June 2018 reports surfaced of an incident from the previous fall in which Cumberbatch leaped from a cab to defend a bicycle <br>
